# Shape-Data-Analyser
This application reads in shape data that exist in a theoretical 2D plane and is able to compute the area of these shapes, display a report on all shapes and sort the shapes by their type and area.

Steps to run application:
1) Clone the repository
2) Compile SDP.cpp using any C++ compiler
3) Run the compiled application

A text file 'ShapesSampleData.txt' describes some sample shape data for testing purposes.
